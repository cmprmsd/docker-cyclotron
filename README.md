## Introduction

[Cyclotron](https://cyclotron.io) is a browser-based platform built by [Expedia](https://expedia.com) for constructing dashboards. Build on and requiring [MongoDB](https://mongdb.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), It provides standard boilerplate and plumbing, allowing non-programmers to easily create and edit dashboards using customizable components. It has a built-in dashboard editor, and hosts the dashboards directly.
